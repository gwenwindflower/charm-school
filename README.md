# ‚ú®üíÑ Welcome, girly! üíÖüèª‚ú®

You've found yourself at charm school, the easiest way to get your terminal and editor into shape for data work. This is an _opinionated_ set of dotfiles that is easy to install, but I will endeavor to explain these opinions and purpose via extensive commenting and documentation. I welcome issues and PRs to add docs and explanation for specific areas.

I see this repository as useful mainly for folks who (sanely) don't enjoy gardening their dotfiles, want a general framework to start from, and are comfortable editing the defaults and ripping out what they don't like.

This is only tested on my personal 2020 MacBook Pro and my work 2022 M2 Macbook Pro, running recent versions of MacOS. I would not install these dotfiles on anything else. If you're running an Intel Mac with a recent version of MacOS you should be fine, but use at your own risk. There's no easy way to undo the install yet if you don't like the settings. I hope in the future to add more optional paths, CI, uninstall scripts, and customizable install options to share this with a larger audience in a more robust way, but until that day, send your computer to Charm School at your own risk.

## How to work with this repo

The install is managed via [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). This is installed in the repo as a submodule along with two plugins to manage [Homebrew](https://github.com/wren/dotbot-brew) and provide more legible [conditional installations](https://gitlab.com/gnfzdz/dotbot-conditional/).

### Do the thing

If you're inside the repo, you simply run `source install` and dotbot will do its thing.

### ‚úåüèª A note on vim

I learned to code in vim. It's what the senior engineers at the company I first worked at did, and they made me work in it to get their help. I'm deeply grateful they did this. Vim as a philosophy is initially intimidating, but elegant and fast when you get used to it.

You should be excited to walk the path of vim to use these dotfiles or you will be fighting against the flow of all the configurations.

### Other recommend tools not included

I use VSCode sometimes and I like it a lot, but it feels like Microsoft really wants you to use their cloud settings sync, and it's easier to just go with that flow for me.

I also heavily, heavily recommend [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) but they also maintain a great cloud settings sync system, and many of the tools have access to sensitive data and workflows, so it's easier to keep it out of this repo. You should really use it though!
