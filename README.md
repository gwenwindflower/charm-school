# ✨ Welcome, traveler! ✨

You've entered the cockpit of the ESS Cutey.py, a Butterfly-class cruiser in the Star Elf fleet. This vessel is captained by Princess Winnie and is currently on patrol in the Data Nebula.

This handbook will go over the many mods Princess Winnie has made to the vessel, in case you too would like to upgrade your starship in such a way (or she forgets).

These modifications should be safe on a starship running MacOS 12+.

## Shell

- `zsh` is the move.
- `ohmyzsh` to manage it.

## Prompt
